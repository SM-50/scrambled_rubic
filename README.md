🧩 Rubik Solver
✨ A Rubik's Cube scrambled project using C++! 🚀 This project is designed for those interested in problem-solving algorithms and C++ programming. The Rubik's Cube is one of the classic challenges in the world of puzzles and mathematical problems, and this program provides multiple features to let you interact with it.

📌 Features
🔄✨ Ability to rotate all faces (clockwise and counterclockwise) with dedicated functions
🎨📊 Displays the cube numerically along with a color guide for better understanding
🏗🛠️ Clean and modular structure for rotation functions and cube state changes, making it easier to develop and optimize
🎲🔀 Randomized cube state generation to increase challenge and test solving algorithms
📏📌 Color distribution analysis to ensure Rubik's Cube rules are maintained
🧠📖 Easy to learn for beginners and configurable for advanced users
⚡🎯 Fast execution with minimal dependencies
🚀 How to Run
T
✅ just run cpp file your code editor 😂😁.

🎨 Color Guide
Number	Color
 G	🟩 Green (back Face)
 W	⚪ White (Top Face)
 R	🔴 Red (Left Face)
 O	🟠 Orange (Right Face)
 B	🔵 Blue (front Face)
 Y	🟡 Yellow (down Face)
📜 How It Works
Upon execution, the program follows these steps:

🎲🔀 you have 4 item in the menu .
🔄🖲️ Allows you to check rotation of different faces including both clockwise and counterclockwise moves.
📊📋 you can a play rubic game 😂😁.
🎨📌 give you the scrambled rubic the work was the project made for it .
📜⚙️ and at the end you can see my introduction.
